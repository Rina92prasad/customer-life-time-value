# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
1. Introduction
Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is a critical metric that represents the total revenue a business can expect
from a customer over time. This project aims to build a predictive model to estimate LTV based on customer
behavior and transaction history.
2. Abstract
We analyzed e-commerce transaction data and built a regression model to predict Customer Lifetime Value
using behavioral features such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM). Models like Random
Forest and XGBoost were implemented, with performance evaluated using MAE and R2 score.
3. Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
4. Steps Involved in Building the Project
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering (RFM values)
3. Train-Test Split (80-20)
4. Model Training (XGBoost, Random Forest)
5. Evaluation using MAE and R2 Score
5. Conclusion
The developed model accurately predicted Customer Lifetime Value and can be utilized for customer
segmentation and personalized marketing. Future improvements could include time-series features or
customer demographic data.
